Subject: Important Update: How to Properly Fold a T-Shirt
To: <projektkush@gmail.com>


*Hi Alex,*

We know life can get busy, so we thought we’d share something truly
essential—how to fold a T-shirt like a pro. Because, let’s face it,
everyone needs perfectly folded T-shirts, right?
*Step-by-Step Guide:*

   1. *Lay the T-Shirt Flat:* Make sure it's wrinkle-free (or as close as
   possible).
   2. *Fold One Side In:* Bring the sleeve in towards the middle.
   3. *Fold the Other Side:* Repeat on the other side. You should now have
   a long rectangle.
   4. *Fold in Half:* Fold from the bottom up to the collar. Boom! You’ve
   got yourself a neatly folded T-shirt.

*Why This Matters:*

   - *It Really Doesn’t:* But hey, at least your closet will look more
   organized!
   - *Impress Your Friends:* When they see your perfectly folded T-shirts,
   they’ll be amazed—or not.
   - *Save Space:* Actually, this might be the one useful thing here. More
   room for snacks in your dorm!

*Bonus Tip:*

   - *The Roll Method:* For the truly adventurous, try rolling your
   T-shirts instead. It’s less conventional, but who needs conventions anyway?

Thanks for tuning in to this absolutely critical update. We know you’re now
equipped with the knowledge to conquer your laundry like never before.

Until next time, stay folded!
