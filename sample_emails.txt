Subject: How to deploy an ML model to production

Let’s go step-by-step through the deployment workflow of a real-world ML REST API, following MLOps best practices.
Let’s GO!
The starting point
Imagine today is your first day as an ML engineer at Uber, and your task is to improve the ML service that predicts the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA). The ETA service gives the end users an estimate of when the driver will arrive at the pickup location.
As a starter, you talk to data engineers in the team, check how the current model works and what features uses. After that, you get your hands-dirty and
prepare training data,
train an ML model,
plot a few evaluation metrics, and
store the final model artifact as a pickle in your local drive.
You are happy with the results, so you think it would be a good idea to deploy the model to production.
The question is: HOW?
From model prototypes to REST APIs
So far you have
the model artifact you saved locally to disk, and
an inference.py script with a predict function, that
loads the model artifact,
transform raw features into model features, with the necessary pre-processing steps,
passes these final features to the model to generate predictions, and
returns these predictions
And if you have some experience with Docker, you can also go 2 steps further and write
A FastAPI or Flask wrapper around your Python code, to build the REST API, and
A Dockerfile to package all the dependencies your code needs in an isolated box, that can be easily deployed to any compute engine.
This is all fantastic. You can easily spin up this container locally, and everything works like a charm.
However, as long as you don’t deploy this container to a production REST API, you will generate 0 business value for the company.
So the question is,
How can I deploy this container as a production ready REST API?
The MLOps way
MLOps is a set of best practices and workflows that, among other things, help you move ML prototypes to production environments (aka deployments) safely.
What does the workflow look like in this case?
Let’s go step by step.
Step 1 → Push code to new branch and open Pull Request (PR)
The first thing is to use git and Github/Gitlab to track code changes. I recommend you develop your code in a non-master branch, that you can name as you wish. For example.
# Create new branch
$ git checkout -b new_eta_model

# Do work....

# Commit changes to local branch
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Initial commit'
Once you are happy with the results, you push the code to the remote repository on Github/Gitlab
$ git push
and open a pull request to merge your changes to the master branch.
Why not merge directly to master branch?
The master branch contains the exact code version that is deployed currently in the ETA REST API.
So, before merging to master, it is necessary to check that your new model is actually better than the one in master, that is currently running in production.
This is precisely what the Continuous Integration pipeline does.
Step 2 → Continuous Integration (CI)
The Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline is a github action that is triggered automatically every time you open a Pull Request. The end goal is to make sure that your new code version, and model artifact are actually good and deserve to be promoted to production.
In this case, our github action does the following:
Run unit tests, for example, to make sure you feature engineering functions work as expected. For that, you can use a library like pytest.
Runs the training script from your “new_eta_model” branch and generates the model artifact.
Validates the ML model performance and possible biases, using a library like Giskard.
At the end, the pipeline checks can either
→ fail, so you need to work further on your code, or move to another project with higher priority, or
→ pass, so your model is ready to be deployed. In this case,
the CI pipeline pushes the model to your model registry, from where it can later be deployed, and
your branch “my_new_model” gets merged to master.
What is a model registry?
A model registry is a repository used to store and version your team’s ML models.  It helps you and your team track models as they move from development to production.
If you haven’t used any before, I suggest you use a serverless one, like CometML. It is free and fully managed, so you do not need to spend time setting up and monitoring infrastructure.
Step 3 → Continuous Deployment (CD)
The Continuos Deployment (CD) pipeline is another github action that is triggered automatically after successful completion of the CI pipeline.
The role of the CD pipeline is to deploy the Dockerfile you wrote as a production ready API endpoint, that the rest of the services inside Uber infrastructure can call to request predictions.
In this case, our github action
Pushes the Docker image to Uber’s docker registry,
Triggers the deployment to your compute platform, for example
Kubernetes, using manifest files and kubectl apply -f
AWS Lambda, using the AWS CLI, or
Serverless platforms, like Beam, Cerebrium or Modal, that do not require Docker images at all.
Bonus 1 → Integration testing in Staging
ML systems are way more than just the ML artifact you generated. So, to test your ML end-to-end it is best practice to actually deploy it in a non-production environment, often called Staging, where you can send requests and log any relevant metric, including:
response accuracy,
latency, if it is critical for your use case
Bonus 2 → Testing in Production
Finally, the most reliable (but potentially dangerous) way to test your ML system is to actually use it in production, for a small percentage of requests.
There are several techniques to do so, including:
A/B tests
Shadow deployments, or
Canary deployments
In any case, you need to have an API Gateway (which for sure Uber has :-)) that can randomly route every incoming request to one of the models, either
the base model that was already running in production, and
the test model that you want to evaluate in a 100% real-world setting.
You need to monitor the performance of each model, compare it, and conclude wheter your new model deserves to be promoted to production.

1. Exploring the multi-index RAG server
We are using Superlinked [  ] to implement a powerful vector compute server. With just a few lines of code, we can implement a fully-fledged RAG application exposed as a REST API web server.
When using Superlinked [  ], you declare your chunking, embedding and query strategy in a declarative way (similar to building a graph), making it extremely easy to implement an end-to-end workflow.
Let’s explore the core steps in how to define an RAG server using Superlinked ↓
First, you have to define the schema of your data, which in our case are the post, article, and repositories schemas:
from superlinked import schema

@schema
class PostSchema:
  content: String
  platform: String
  ... # Other fields

@schema
class RepositorySchema:
  content: String
  platform: String
  ...

@schema
class ArticleSchema:
  content: String
  platform: String
  ...

post = PostSchema()
article = ArticleSchema()
repository = RepositorySchema()
You can quickly define an embedding space based on one or more schema attributes. The embedding space is made out of the following properties:
the field to be embedded;
a model used to embed the field.
For example, this is how you can define an embedding space for a piece of text, more precisely on the content of the article:
from superlinked import TextSimilaritySpace, chunk

articles_space_content = TextSimilaritySpace(
    text=chunk(article.content, chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=50),
    model=settings.EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID,
)
Notice that we also wrapped the article's content field with the chunk() function that automatically chunks the text before embedding it.
The model can be any embedding model available on HuggingFace or SentenceTransformers. For example, we used the following MODEL_ID:
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings

class Settings(BaseSettings):
  EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID: str = "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"

  REDIS_HOSTNAME: str = "redis"
  REDIS_PORT: int = 6379

settings = Settings()
It also supports defining an embedding space for categorical variables, such as the article’s platform:
from superlinked import CategoricalSimilaritySpace,

articles_space_plaform = CategoricalSimilaritySpace(
    category_input=article.platform,
    categories=["medium", "superlinked"],
    negative_filter=-5.0,
)
Along with text and categorical embedding spaces, Superlinked supports numerical and temporal variables:
TextSimilaritySpace [  ]
CategoricalSimilaritySpace [  ]
RecencySpace [  ]
NumberSpace [  ]
Multi-index structures
Now, we can combine the two embedding spaces defined above into a multi-index structure:
from superlinked import Index

article_index = Index(
    [articles_space_content, articles_space_plaform],
    fields=[article.author_id],
)
The first attribute is a list with references to the text and categorical embedding spaces. At the same time, the fields parameter contains a list of all the fields to which we want to apply filters when querying the data. These steps will optimize retrieval and filter operations to run at low latencies.
Note that when defining an Index in Superlinked, we can add as many embedding spaces as we like that originate from the same schema, in our case, the ArticleSchema, where the minimum is one, and the maximum is all the schema fields.
…and, viola!
We defined a multi-index structure that supports weighted queries in just a few lines of code.
Using Superlinked and its embedding space and index architecture, we can easily index different data types (text, categorical, number, temporal) into a multi-index structure that offers tremendous flexibility in how we interact with the data.
The following section will show you how to query the multi-index collection defined above. But first, let’s wrap up with the Superlinked RAG server.
To do so, let’s define a connector to a Redis Vector DB:
from superlinked import RedisVectorDatabase

vector_database = RedisVectorDatabase(
    settings.REDIS_HOSTNAME,
    settings.REDIS_PORT,
)
…and ultimately define a RestExecutor that wraps up everything from above into a REST API server:
from superlinked import RestSource, RestExecutor, SuperlinkedRegistry

article_source = RestSource(article)
repository_source = RestSource(repository)
post_source = RestSource(post)

executor = RestExecutor(
    sources=[article_source, repository_source, post_source],
    indices=[article_index, repository_index, post_index],
    queries=[
        RestQuery(RestDescriptor("article_query"), article_query),
        RestQuery(RestDescriptor("repository_query"), repository_query),
        RestQuery(RestDescriptor("post_query"), post_query),
    ],
    vector_database=vector_database,
)
SuperlinkedRegistry.register(executor)
Based on all the queries defined in the RestExecutor class, Superlinked will automatically generate endpoints that can be called through HTTP requests.
In Lesson 11 [  ], we showed in more detail how the RAG Superlinked server works, how to set it up and how to interact with its query endpoints:
2. Understanding the data ingestion pipeline
Before we understand how to build queries for our multi-index collections, let’s have a quick refresher on how the vector DB is populated with article, post, and repository documents.
The data ingestion workflow is illustrated in Figure 2. During the LLM Twin course, we implemented a real-time data collection system in the following way:
We crawl the data from the internet and store it in a MongoDB data warehouse.
We use CDC to capture CRUD events on the database and send them as messages to a RabbitMQ queue.
We use a Bytewax streaming engine [  ] to consume and clean the events from RabbitMQ in real time.
Ultimately, the data is ingested into the Superlinked server through HTTP requests.
As seen before, the Superlinked server does the heavy lifting, such as chunking, embedding, and loading all the ingested data into a Redis vector DB.
We implemented a vector DB retrieval client that queries the data from Superlinked through HTTP requests.
The vector DB retrieval will be used within the final RAG component, which generates the final response using the retrieved context and an LLM.
Note that whenever we crawl a new document from the Internet, we repeat steps 1–5, resulting in a vector DB synced with the external world in real-time.
If you want to see the full implementation of the steps above, you can always check out the rest of the course’s lessons for free, starting with Lesson 1 [  ].
But now that we have an intuition on how the Redis vector DB is populated with data used for RAG let’s see the true power of Superlinked and build some queries to retrieve data.
3. Writing complex multi-index RAG queries using Superlinked
Let’s take a look at the complete article query we want to define:
article_query = (
    Query(
        article_index,
        weights={
            articles_space_content: Param("content_weight"),
            articles_space_plaform: Param("platform_weight"),
        },
    )
    .find(article)
    .similar(articles_space_content.text, Param("search_query"))
    .similar(articles_space_plaform.category, Param("platform"))
    .filter(article.author_id == Param("author_id"))
    .limit(Param("limit"))
)
If it seems like a lot, let’s break it into smaller pieces and start with the beginning.
What if we want to make a basic query that finds the most relevant articles solely based on the similarity between the query and the content of an article?
In the code snippet below, we define a query based on the article’s index to find articles that have the embedding of the content field most similar to the search query:
article_query = (
    Query(article_index)
    .find(article)
    .similar(articles_space_content.text, Param("search_query"))
)
As seen in the Exploring the multi-index RAG server section, plugging this query into the RestExecutor class automatically creates an API endpoint accessible through POST HTTP requests.
In Figure 3, we can observe all the available endpoints automatically generated by Superlinked.
Thus, after starting the Superlinked server, which we showed how to do in Lesson 11 [  ], you can access the query as follows:
import httpx

url=f"{base_url}/api/v1/search/article_query"
headers = {"Accept": "*/*", "Content-Type": "application/json"}

data = {
      "search_query": "Write me a post about Vector DBs and RAG.",
}
response = httpx.post(
    url, headers=headers, json=data, timeout=600
)
print(result["obj"])
As you can observe, all the attributes wrapped by the Param() class within the query are expected as parameters within the POST request, such as the Param(“search_query”), which represents the user’s query.
Quite intuitive, right?
Now… What happens behind the scenes?
After the endpoint is called, the Superlinked server processes the search query based on the articles_space_content embedding text space, which defines how to chunk and embed a text.
Thus, that will happen to the search query: it will chunk and embed it.
Using the computed query embedding, it will search the vector space based on the article’s content and retrieve the most similar documents:
articles_space_content = TextSimilaritySpace(
    text=chunk(article.content, chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=50),
    model="sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2",
)
Multi-index query
Now that we understand the basics of how a Superlinked query works, let’s add another layer of complexity and create a multi-index query based on the article’s content and platform:
article_query = (
    Query(
        article_index,
        weights={
            articles_space_content: Param("content_weight"),
            articles_space_plaform: Param("platform_weight"),
        },
    )
    .find(article)
    .similar(articles_space_content.text, Param("search_query"))
    .similar(articles_space_plaform.category, Param("platform"))
)
We added two things.
The first one is another similar() function call, which configures the other embedding space we should use for the query, which is articles_space_plaform.
Now, when making a query, Superlinked will use the embedding of both fields to search for relevant information:
the search query
the article’s platforms
But how do we configure which one is more important?
Here, the second thing that we added kicks in, which is the weights parameter within the Query(weights={…}) class.
Using the weights dictionary, we can add different weights per index to configure the importance of each within a particular query.
Let’s better understand this with an example:
data = {
    "search_query": "Write me a post about Vector DBs and RAG.",
    "platform": "medium",
    "content_weight": 0.9, # 90%
    "platform_weight": 0.1, # 10%
}
response = httpx.post(
    url, headers=self.headers, json=data, timeout=self.timeout
)
In the previous example, we set the content weight to 90% and the platform’s to 10%, which means that the article’s content will most impact our query but still favor articles from the same platform.
By playing with these weights, we tweak the impact of each index in our query.
Now, let’s add the last final pieces of the query, which are the filter() and the limit() functions:
article_query = (
    Query(
        article_index,
        weights={
            articles_space_content: Param("content_weight"),
            articles_space_plaform: Param("platform_weight"),
        },
    )
    .find(article)
    .similar(articles_space_content.text, Param("search_query"))
    .similar(articles_space_plaform.category, Param("platform"))
    .filter(article.author_id == Param("author_id"))
    .limit(Param("limit"))
)
The author_id filter helps us retrieve documents only from a specific author, while the limit function controls how many items we want to retrieve.
For example, if we find 10 similar articles but the limit is set to 3, the Superlinked server will always return a maximum of 3 documents. Thus reducing network I/O between the server and client:
data = {
    "search_query": "Write me a post about Vector DBs and RAG.",
    "platform": "medium",
    "content_weight": 0.9, # 90%
    "platform_weight": 0.1, # 10%
    "author_id": 145,
    "limit": 3,
}
response = httpx.post(
    url, headers=self.headers, json=data, timeout=self.timeout
)
That’s it! We can further optimize our retrieval step by experimenting with other multi-index configurations and weights.
4. Is Superlinked OP for building RAG and other vector-based apps?
Superlinked [  ] has incredible potential to build scalable vector servers to ingest and retrieve your data based on operations between embeddings.
As you’ve seen in Lesson 11 [  ] and Lesson 12, in just a few lines of code, we’ve:
implemented clean and modular schemas for your data;
chunked and embedded the data;
added embedding support for multiple data types (text, categorical, numerical, temporal);
implemented multi-index collections and queries, allowing us to optimize our retrieval step;
connectors for multiple vector DBs (Redis, MongoDB, etc.)
optimized filtered vector search.
The truth is that Superlinked [  ] is still a young Python framework.
But as it grows, it will become more stable and introduce even more features, such as rerank, making it an excellent choice for implementing your vector search layer.
If you are curious, check out Superlinked [  ] to learn more about them.
Conclusion
Within this article, you’ve learned how to implement multi-index collections and queries for advanced RAG using Superlinked [  ].
After to better understand how Superlinked queries work, we gradually presented how to build a complex query that:
uses two vector indexes;
adds filters based on the metadata extracted with an LLM;
returns only the top K elements to reduce network I/O overhead.
Ultimately, we looked into how Superlinked can help us implement and optimize various advanced RAG methods, such as query expansion, self-query, filtered vector search and rerank.
This was the last lesson of the LLM Twin course. I hope you learned a lot during these sessions.
Decoding ML is grateful that you are here to expand your production ML knowledge from our resources.

Most important thing is your mindset Kush.

​

It's the only thing you have GENUINE control over.

​

Don't let external things influence your happiness or state of
mind.

​

You have full control over your life.

​

Maybe you grew up in a council estate in the U.K.,

​

Lost family members young,

​

Born in a less economically developed country?

​

Never been with a 10 or even a couple 8.5s?

​

You can’t change your upbringing Kush,

​

Just accept things for how they are.

​

Annica.

​

the law of impermanence.

​

Change is inherent in all phenomenal existence,

​

all physical and mental formations are impermanent.

​

Wake up each day smiling mate,

​

Maybe you don’t like your current scenario today,

​

Maybe things will stay the exact same in a few months...

​

But everything must change,

​

And you have the power to make it happen

​

cheers bro
