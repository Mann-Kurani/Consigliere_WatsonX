Because, let\u2019s face it,\neveryone needs perfectly folded T-shirts, right?\n*Step-by-Step Guide:*\n\n   1. *Lay the T-Shirt Flat:* Make sure it's wrinkle-free (or as close as\n   possible).\n   2. *Fold One Side In:* Bring the sleeve in towards the middle.\n   3. *Fold the Other Side:* Repeat on the other side. You should now have\n   a long rectangle.\n   4. *Fold in Half:* Fold from the bottom up to the collar. Boom! You\u2019ve\n   got yourself a neatly folded T-shirt.\n\n*Why This Matters:*\n\n   - *It Really Doesn\u2019t:* But hey, at least your closet will look more\n   organized!\n   - *Impress Your Friends:* When they see your perfectly folded T-shirts,\n   they\u2019ll be amazed\u2014or not.\n   - *Save Space:* Actually, this might be the one useful thing here. More\n   room for snacks in your dorm!\n\n*Bonus Tip:*\n\n   - *The Roll Method:* For the truly adventurous, try rolling your\n   T-shirts instead. It\u2019s less conventional, but who needs conventions anyway?\n\nThanks for tuning in to this absolutely critical update. We know you\u2019re now\nequipped with the knowledge to conquer your laundry like never before.\n\nUntil next time, stay folded!\n\n*Best regards,*\nThe Totally Unnecessary Tips Team\nno-reply@pointlesstips.com\n(555) 987-6543",
